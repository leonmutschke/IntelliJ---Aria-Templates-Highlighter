Aria Templates Syntax Highlighting for template files in IntelliJ
=================================================================

This repository contains a syntax highlighter for AT template files for IntelliJ.

# Install
To install clone the repository and copy the `Aria Templates.xml` file to the `filetypes` folder that is located in the IDE's `config` folder.
The `config` folder can be found in the users home folder (see below).

Once you have found the `config` folder, open it and in there you should have the `filetypes` folder.
Open that folder and put the `Aria Templates.xml` file in there. Should the folder be missing, create it.

In my case the `filetypes` folder is located here:

e.g.: `C:\Users\leon\.IntelliJIdea2018.1\config\filetypes`

## Windows Vista, 7,8, 10:
`<SYSTEM DRIVE>\Users\<USER ACCOUNT NAME>\.<PRODUCT><VERSION>`

## Linux and other Unix Systems

` ~/.<PRODUCT><VERSION>`

## Mac OS X

`~/Library/Preferences/<PRODUCT><VERSION>`
